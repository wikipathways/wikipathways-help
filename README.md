## Pathway-specific Discussions

This repo contains discussions for specific pathways at [WikiPathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/). Where appropriate (and after discussion on this repo has concluded), specific discussions will be transferred to [Pathway Curation Tasks](https://github.com/wikipathways/pathway-curation-tasks/issues).
